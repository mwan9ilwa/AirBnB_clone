# AirBnB Clone | The Console

## Description
This project aims to create a simplified version of AirBnB, a platform for booking accommodations, by building a command-line interface (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects. It involves creating classes for various objects like User, State, City, Place, etc., along with a storage engine for serialization/deserialization.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter allows users to interact with the AirBnB objects through the command line. It supports various commands for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects, as well as other operations like counting and computing statistics.

### How to Start
To start the command interpreter, simply run the `console.py` script.

### How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can type commands at the prompt `(hbnb)` and press Enter to execute them.

### Examples
Here are some examples of commands you can use:
